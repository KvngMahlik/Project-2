            <p>
                Veganism is a lifestyle and dietary choice that seeks to eliminate the use of animal products.
                It excludes not only meat but also dairy, eggs, and any other animal-derived ingredients.
                Vegans also often extend this philosophy to other areas of their lives,avoiding products like leather
                and cosmetics tested on animals.
                Not to mention the meat you are eating is considered dead and may carry bacteria.
